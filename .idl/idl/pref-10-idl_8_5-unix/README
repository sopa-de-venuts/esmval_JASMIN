   This directory is used by IDL to hold the files that
maintain user preference state information between IDL sessions.
It is easiest to allow IDL to manage the preference file rather
than manipulating it outside of IDL. However, you are allowed
to edit the preference file or delete any file found here,
as described below. If you do so, you must first ensure that
there are no running instances of IDL that can access this
directory. Altering the contents of this directory outside of
IDL's control while an IDL session is running can confuse IDL.

    [] You may edit the preference file (idl.pref) using any
       standard text editor. The preferences and their allowed
       values are described in the IDL documentation which is
       included with IDL. Please note that IDL has a user level
       API for managing user preferences. Although you are
       allowed to edit the file directly, it is not required.

    [] If you do edit the preference file, don't remove or alter
       the comment header at the beginning. PREF_MIGRATE depends
       on it to extract information about the IDL that wrote the
       file. If it doesn't find that information, it will ignore
       the file.

    [] You may remove any files found here. If you remove a file,
       IDL will recreate it if it is needed. Any customizations
       contained in the deleted file will be lost, and the IDL
       generated replacement will revert to default values.
